### EXERCISE
Implement a basic todolist. Each todo is represented as a string within the array.
- MILESTONE 1
Print within a list, an item for each todo.
- MILESTONE 2
Display next to each item has an "x": clicking on it, the todo is removed from the list.
- MILESTONE 3
Prepare a text input field and an "add" button: by clicking on the button, the typed text is read and used to create a new todo, which is then added to the list of existing todos.
- BONUS 1
In addition to clicking on the button, also intercept the ENTER key to add todo to the list
- BONUS 2
Transform each todo into an object, formed by two properties:
  text, a string indicating todo text
  done, a boolean (true/false) indicating whether the todo has been done or not. If done is true, show the crossed-out todo text.
As a result, change the input feature to add a new object to the list instead of the simple string.
- BONUS 3
By clicking on the item text, reverse the value of the corresponding todoâ€™s done property (if done was equal to false, set true if not false)
